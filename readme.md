A robust collection that forms the core add-on in the R.E.P.O Cheat Suite. This repository gathers modules, libraries, and tooling to support a cohesive set of features for researchers, developers, and power users who work with game-tacing and mod-assembly in a controlled environment. The project is designed to be modular, extensible, and respectful of the ecosystems it touches. It centers on clean interfaces, clear boundaries, and a measurable approach to integration across the suite’s components.

This repository is built to be team-friendly and starter-friendly. It serves as a central hub where contributors can collaborate on core concepts, common utilities, and shared patterns that other parts of the R.E.P.O Cheat Suite rely on. The emphasis is on transparency, quality, and maintainable design. The modules inside are intended to be interoperable, so that adding or updating one part does not create unexpected ripple effects in the rest of the system.

Emojis help mark ideas and sections as you skim. This readme uses them to highlight key areas, but content remains accessible for readers who prefer a straightforward, plain-text approach. The overall goal is to present a clear map of what this repo is, what it contains, and how to work with it in a responsible, well-structured way.

Overview

This project sits at the intersection of tooling, compatibility, and convenience. It ties together core components of the R.E.P.O Cheat Suite and provides a stable base for developers who want to build additional features, experiments, or companions that align with the suite’s architecture. The modpack approach lets teams share assets, utilities, and integration hooks in a single, cohesive distribution, while keeping boundaries clear and expectations explicit.

The core addon interacts with a set of modules that cover a wide range of needs. Some modules focus on compatibility shims, others on small but useful utilities, and a few handle orchestration tasks that coordinate the actions of multiple components. The goal is to minimize duplication, reduce coupling, and support a clean upgrade path as the suite evolves.

- Clear scope: This repository focuses on core integration, shared libraries, and the glue that makes the suite work smoothly.
- Extensibility: The architecture encourages adding new modules without rewriting existing code.
- Portability: The components are designed to be portable across environments, with sensible defaults and straightforward overrides.

Key Concepts
